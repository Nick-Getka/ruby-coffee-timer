# ruby-coffee-timer
A quick project designed for me to learn a bit about Ruby on Rails.  Given a drink name, drink price and tip, the page calculates the amount of time you have in a coffee shop before you should really buy another drink.
## Running the Project
The project can be run locally by installing ruby, rails, and the required gems and then running <TBD>.  The project can also be run using Docker using the Dockerfile in the project root.  This will automate the installation of ruby, rails and the required gems, but require docker and its components to already be installed
